## Inspiration
In urban environments and cities, the metropolis sometimes lacks ease of transport due to the lack of consistent transportation as well as the influx of traffic. We wanted to create a platform to connect others who are economically and environmentally aware together to minimize the number of vehicles on the road.

## What it does
This platform allows for people to plan and coordinate rides together. One can create their own ride or join a pool that someone else has already set up.

## How we built it
- Built a web-app using Javascript. Frameworks included node.js, express.js, react, Google Firebase authentication, and Cloud Firestore.

## Challenges we ran into
- Connecting API endpoints between the front end, backend 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- An MVP using technology we have just learned
- Building a web-app

## What we learned
- Full-stack development while communicating between the three of us to get each other's requirements for API endpoints
- Iterating, improving, and transitioning our ideas in a relatively quick manner

## What's next for Backseat
- Adding Quality of Life updates and improvements
- Incorporating autocomplete in Google Maps APIs
- hosting our web application on a domain
